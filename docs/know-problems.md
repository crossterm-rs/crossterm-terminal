# Known Problems

There are some problems I discovered during development. 
And I don't think it has to do anything with crossterm but it has to do whit how terminals handle ANSI or WinApi. 

## UNIX-terminals

The Arc and Manjaro KDE Konsole's are not seeming to resize the terminal instead they are resizing the buffer.
